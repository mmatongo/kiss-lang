KISS LANGUAGE REPO
---

This is repo dedicated to language
compilers etc for any https://kisslinux.org based distro.

Because KISS and it's derivatives are source based and pretty much every package
can be managed by anyone, I saw the need to make this repo
to put into one place the languages you might end up
needing.
